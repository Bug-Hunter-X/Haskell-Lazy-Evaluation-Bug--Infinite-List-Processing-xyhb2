The solution involves adding a check to prevent the creation of an infinite list.  If the condition is true, instead of generating an infinite list, it will generate a finite list instead.

```haskell
condition :: Bool
condition = True -- Change this to False to avoid the infinite loop

finiteListLength :: Int
finiteListLength = 10

potentiallyInfiniteList :: [Int]
potentiallyInfiniteList = if condition then take finiteListLength $ iterate (+1) 0 else []

processList :: [Int] -> Int
processList [] = 0
processList (x:xs) = x + processList xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = processList potentiallyInfiniteList
  print result
```
This revised code avoids the infinite loop by limiting the list's length.  This demonstrates a key strategy in handling potentially infinite data structures in Haskell: always ensure there's a condition to make the list generation stop.
