This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite data structures.  The function `potentiallyInfiniteList` can produce an infinite list if `condition` is always true. When `processList` attempts to process this infinite list, it will never terminate.

```haskell
condition :: Bool
condition = True -- Change this to False to avoid the infinite loop

potentiallyInfiniteList :: [Int]
potentiallyInfiniteList = if condition then 0 : potentiallyInfiniteList else []

processList :: [Int] -> Int
processList [] = 0
processList (x:xs) = x + processList xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = processList potentiallyInfiniteList
  print result
```
